intermediate-nlp.ipynb:

Code include preprocessing data and encoding with CountVectorizer, onehot and ordinal encoding. For classification, we used bert, distillBert, SVM, naive bayes, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest, KNN, Voting and Stacking, FB's Zero shot model, FB's Fast text, TF Bert. BertAutoModel with LSTM, Deep neural nets, etc.

mlbuzz-intermediate-nn.ipynb:

Code includes encoding using onehot, countVectorizer and ordinal encoder. PCA is also used for feature extraction. Classification models include LSTM, Bert with LSTM, Bert with Dense, etc.

fork-of-mlbuzz-intermediate-nn-289b3d.ipynb:

Code includes encoding using onehot, countVectorizer and ordinal encoder. PCA is also used for feature extraction. Classification models include combination of LSTM & Bert.
